# Bankrupt

###

The simulation was coded in Java.

To run you can either do it by using an IDE (I recommend using Eclipse) or run it using your OS shell.

To run it on the shell, got to the project folder `bankrupt` and run the following commands:

```
	javac src/games/*.java
```

```
	java -cp src game.Main
```

In case you get an error `'javac' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.`, that means you didn't set the path to java compiler. To do that you need to download Java Development Kit (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html), and set the path by using the following command:

```
	set path="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_171\bin"
```

`C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_171\bin` can change depending on where you have installed JDK.
